ORDER BY clause :

	The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.



----sort by ascending order
	select * from demom order by id;

----sort by descending order
	 select * from demom order by id desc;

----sort by two columns
	select * from demom order by id, name;
	
	if duplicate id found then those records will be 	sorted by name.(both ASC)

----
	select * from demom order by id DESC,name DESC;
	select * from demom order by id ASC,name desc;
 i.e   select * from demom order by id ASC,name desc;

	if duplicate id found then those records will be 		sorted by name in DESC order.(id ASC, name DESC)
e.g
select * from demom;

        ID NAME
---------- -------------------
        10 abc
        10 bcd
        30 cde

SQL> select * from demom order by id,name;

        ID NAME
---------- -------------------
        10 abc
        10 bcd
        30 cde

SQL> select * from demom order by id,name desc;

        ID NAME
